# Into the Turing Tarpit (December 2012)

[Competition](https://web.archive.org/web/20140910193725/http://www.pltgames.com/competition/2012/12)

## Description

We're going to start with something easy. Something *minimal*. In fact, let's
aim for the most minimal we can get.

> Beware of the Turing tar-pit in which everything is possible but nothing of
> interest is easy. - Alan Perlis (Epigrams on Programming, 1982)

Beware of? No, embrace!

A Turing Tarpit is a type of esoteric programming language. It is
Turing-complete but has a very small number of primitives (generally between 2
to 8 operations). This means we *could* use it to write any computable program
but it definitely wouldn't be practical.

A common implementation uses cells as memory, like a traditional Turing machine.
Cells can make up a [tape](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Tape) or grid and
instructions are given to move the cursor and set values.

A common functional implementation uses [rewriting](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Rewriting)
of graphs, [trees](https://www.program-transformation.org/Transform/TreeRewriting)
or some other data structure. Operations are just rewrite rules.

This theme is very open-ended. Go on and write a Turing Tarpit!

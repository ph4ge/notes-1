## Import and export

- [Darcs convert](https://darcs.net/Using/Convert)
- [Fossil import and export](https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/inout.wiki)
- [cvs2gitdump](https://github.com/yasuoka/cvs2gitdump): code from it is used by
  the Software Heritage archive to [load CVS repos](https://forge.softwareheritage.org/source/swh-loader-cvs/browse/master/docs/),
  but it doesn't convert any branches.
- [cvs-fast-export](http://www.catb.org/~esr/cvs-fast-export/cvs-fast-export.html):
  may be better (or something exporting the git fast-export format), but it is
  listed in the alternatives section of cvs2gitdump, so may be worse.

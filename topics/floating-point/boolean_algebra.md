# Boolean algebra with floating-point numbers

Orson Peters demonstrates that IEEE-854 subtraction with +0 and -0 is
functionally complete and equivalent to implication, in
[“Subtraction Is Functionally Complete”](https://orlp.net/blog/subtraction-is-functionally-complete/).

Tom Murphy VII constructs a computer using only floating-point operations in a
binary3 format over NaN and ∞, in [“NaN Gates and Flip FLOPS”](http://tom7.org/nand/).

# Nebula 2 architecture plan

Nebula 2 is a compiler framework for inter-language compilation using a
dynamically-registered mixed-dialect intermediate representation.

The project is very early in development, but the aspirational architecture plan
is as follows:

## Architecture

Languages can be defined and dynamically registered with the Nebula API. They
have their own syntax(es), intermediate language dialect(s), and incremental
transformation passes between arbitrary dialects. Most languages will be able to
serve as a frontend or a backend, using incremental transformations that lower
to or raise from common dialects.

### Language API

**Syntax**: The concrete syntax trees represent program sources losslessly,
including comments and whitespace, and position information is maintained
through all phases. It also has utilities for token scanning and for parsing of
prefix code grammars.

### Dialects

- Memory models
  - Stack
  - Memory buffer
  - Registers
- Data types
  - Lazy thunk expressions

### Mixed-dialect IR

Dialects decouple control flow, data flow, and memory models, to support diverse
representations. The core data flow dialects will include an SSA-based IR, that
uses basic block parameters, and a typed stack-oriented IR. Control flow
dialects will include unstructured with jumps and structured with functions and
loops. There will also be eager values and lazy thunk expressions, as well as
arbitrary-precision integer types, with a data flow analysis to constrain bit
widths.

The dynamic registration allows languages to be defined modularly in independent
projects and for library components to be reused by multiple tools, including
external tools. The toolchain will include a static compiler and a language
server.

### Languages

See [languages.md](languages.md).

### Incremental computation

I intend to use incremental computation via [Salsa](https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa),
as [used](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/salsa.html) by rust-analyzer, or
[Adapton](https://github.com/Adapton/adapton.rust) ([notes](https://github.com/andrewarchi/compiler-notes/tree/main/adapton)),
once I have a working pipeline.

### Inspiration

It takes inspiration from many projects and concepts: MLIR for dialect mixing
and registration; GraalVM for its polyglot API with high-level mixed-language
interoperability and its sea of nodes IR with loose node ordering; LLVM for its
library design and SSA-based IR; the SSA form variant in used in MLIR and
WebAssembly, that uses basic block parameters instead of phi functions; Nanopass
for small transformation passes over many ILs; and Futamura projections for
powerful partial evaluation.

Whitespace is a nice starting point, because its jump-oriented control flow
resembles a minimal LLVM IR, which can be expanded as a general IR with features
added as needed, until itâ€™s 1:1 with LLVM IR.

## Current features

### Languages

- Whitespace
  - Supported supersets: GrassMudHorse
- Brainfuck
  - Supported supersets: Ook! and Spoon

## Approach

forward, then inside-out

# 2023-10-31 Interview with Chris Lattner

Ask if I can record

- My interests
  - Sea of nodes with Cranelift-like æ-graph rewrite system
- You have built successful large-scale projects multiple times
  - LLVM
  - Swift
  - MLIR
  - SiFive, adapting MLIR for RISC-V
  - Mojo, designing a language for MLIR

Was the idea for LLVM yours or your advisor, Vikram Adve’s? So, do you think I’d
have better success finding an advisor, who’s a good fit, by pitching project
ideas to potential advisors or searching for advisors who have a similar project
in mind? How did you pick your advisor? Maybe I am approaching it wrong.

I’ve heard it said that it’s career suicide for grad students to build a
production language and drop normal research, because it’s the wrong incentives.
That didn’t happen to you, though.

From what I know about masters programs, they are primarily coursework and
lighter on the thesis than a PhD: How did you manage to build a viable version
of LLVM in a short time?

Were you hired at Apple to further develop LLVM or did that possibility emerge
after you had been there for a while? It seems like it was the perfect storm: a
need for a GCC successor, compiler needs at Apple, the timing of your work, and
luck. What would you say was the most influential in getting the industry
backing?

I’m pretty convinced, that I want to do a master’s and/or PhD
- I can get what I need out of papers to do my work.
- But, I’ve always preferred writing software over papers.

- Career options
  - New language or compiler infra
    - Chris Lattner LLVM-like:
      - Ambitious master's thesis picked up by Apple
    - Andrew Kelley Zig-like:
      - Side project turned main gig, through donations
      - Informal theory
      - Needs good marketing
    - Go or GraalVM-like:
      - Research arm of a large corporation
  - Existing language or compiler infra
    - GraalVM: get a PhD, likely at JKU Linz

I toy with the idea of taking a more informal route like Andrew Kelley with Zig,
but worry that without traction like his, I’d be dooming my compiler work to be
side projects forever.

I want to make fundamental architectural design decisions, not just hack on an
existing compiler like I did with Graal, but getting any sort of buy-in, even
with sound design, seems like it’s down to non-deterministic luck.

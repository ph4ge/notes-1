# PLT Games

PLT Games was a monthly competition to design a programming language, that
took place seven times starting in December 2012. It received 67 submissions,
many of which are worthy of review.

## Competitions

- [Into the Turing Tarpit (December 2012)](turing_tarpit.md)
- [Testing the Waters (January 2013)](testing.md)
- [Game on (February 2013)](game.md)
- [Do it Live (March 2013)](live.md)
- [Only Syntax (April 2013)](syntax.md)
- [Replace PHP (May 2013)](php.md)
- [Obscure Security Language (September 2013)](security.md)

## Criteria

- Innovation: Does this language introduce you to any new concepts? Does this
  seem like a unique language?
- Completeness: Does the implementation of this language work as intended? Does
  it lack many bugs?
- Theme application: Does the language fit the theme? Does it satisfy the
  constraints in the description?

## My favorites

- [Leaf](https://github.com/CRogers/leaf) by Callum Rogers uses only one binary
  tree, with operations to manipulate it.

- [Cratylus](https://github.com/thaliaarchi/foones-cratylus) by Pablo Barenbaum
  is a polynomial rewriting esolang, that is a superset of Conway's FRACTRAN.
- [Eightfold](https://github.com/thaliaarchi/foones-eightfold) by Pablo
  Barenbaum is a dependently typed esolang.
- [Myopia](https://github.com/miikka/myopia) by Miikka Koskinen is based on
  Âµ-recursive functions.
- [Vigil](https://github.com/munificent/vigil) by Bob Nystrom enforces
  contracts by deleting offending functions from the source code.
- [Turipong](https://github.com/rpav/turipong) by Ryan Pavlik is a Befunge
  derivative inspired by Pong; however it has no user-controlled paddles.

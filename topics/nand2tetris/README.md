# Nand to Tetris

The Hack ALU allows for [far more operations](hack_operations.md)
[[text](hack_operations.txt)] for the C-instruction, than listed in the
[specification](https://www.nand2tetris.org/_files/ugd/44046b_7ef1c00a714c46768f08c459a6cab45a.pdf)
(ยง4.2.3). These could be utilized in a compiler targeting Hack for more
efficient generated code.

Philip Zucker built a formally verified version of Nand to Tetris in Coq,
[nand2coq](https://github.com/philzook58/nand2coq) [[notes](https://www.philipzucker.com/nand2tetris-in-verilog-and-fpga-and-coq/)].

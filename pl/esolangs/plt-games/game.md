# Game on (February 2013)

[Competition](https://web.archive.org/web/20140909011337/http://www.pltgames.com/competition/2013/2)

## Description

Here's a fun theme for February.

*Gamification* is the use of game mechanics to make things more engaging.
Engagement can include metrics like:

- Number of interactions
- Frequency of interactions
- Total time spent interacting

And some example game mechanics include:

- Achievements
- Bonuses
- Levels
- Points
- Progression

It's time to intentionally apply some gamification to programming languages. The
goal of this theme is to create a language where the user is not only a
programmer, they're a player.

Game on!

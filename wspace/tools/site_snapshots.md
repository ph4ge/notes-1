# Snapshots for the Whitespace homepage

When I resurrect the CompSoc Whitespace homepage, I should make snapshots for
changes, grouped in sets, so that it can be browsed at any recorded point in
time. Snapshots would be represented in the URL by date or also, when relevant,
associated release numbers. The UI could be inspired by the Wayback Machine, but
it's not the primary focus, so it should be more subtle or on a separate index
page. To not rely on less-stable commit hashes when referencing snapshots in the
repo, snapshots would be tagged while the repo is being constructed.

Snapshots may also be useful for other sites with revisions.

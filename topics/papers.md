Is `call/cc` like WS `jmp` as opposed to WS `call`?

Values in the heap can refer to other values in the heap, thus being
recursively defined. This doesn't mean that the heap itself is
recursive, or by extension, the store? The heap is just a flat address
space, so I don't think it would be recursive.

# Whitespace 20th Anniversary

I’ve done a lot with Whitespace. When I started, it was a simple procrastination
project during finals week to build an interpreter in C++, but it quickly grew
in ambition. I learned LLVM, so I could build a Whitespace compiler in Go
targeting LLVM IR. Then I built a Whitespace interactive debugger, to learn jq
in depth. It was the first project I built in Rust. I tried making a Whitespace
interpreter in Brainfuck (spoiler alert: it’s difficult). I formalized it in Coq
with small-step semantics. Most recently, over the weekend at a hackathon, I
built an optimizing compiler middle-end in 24 hours, that models Whitespace’s
lazy semantics, eliminates the stack within basic blocks, and performs
common-subexpression elimination.

After learning enough assembly to feel powerful, during finals week, I decided
to build a Whitespace interpreter, since it then felt approachable. That
procrastination project led to numerous interpreters and compilers for
Whitespace, including a Coq formalization, a Go AOT optimizing compiler, an
interpreter in Rust that models the intentional lazy semantics from Haskell, a
debugger in jq, and others.

It activated a latent interest in PL theory. I credit it to solidifying my
interest in PL theory and shifting my studies to that.

I'm applying for grad schools soon. Are there programs in Germany, the US,
Switzerland, Austria, or the Netherlands, that do research in programming
languages? **Be more specific**

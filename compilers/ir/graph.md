# Graph IRs

## Control flow and optimizations

Souper is a superoptimizer for various compilers with its own IR. Since it does
not have control flow, its optimizations are simpler. Could some of this design
be used when combined with control flow and e-graphs, to remove the acyclicity
constraint of ae-graphs?

Souper also has phis:

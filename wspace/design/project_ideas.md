# Whitespace project ideas

- Back-end
  - Struct codegen
    - Arbitrary-precision rational type (2 values)
- Library
  - IEEE-754 floating-point implementation by integer arithmetic
- Languages
  - Lua: interpreter in Whitespace or a front-end
  - Apollo Guidance Computer: evaluate whether AGC code would be possible for
    codegen or as a front-end and that the generated programs would be
    interesting

# Turing tarpits

The inaugural PLT Games December 2012 competition [“Into the Tarpit”](https://web.archive.org/web/20140910193725/http://www.pltgames.com/competition/2012/12)
challenged participants to design a minimal programming language. It received 52
submissions, many of which are worthy of review, and it was followed by
[three more contests](https://web.archive.org/web/20141024141413/http://www.pltgames.com/competition/list)
receiving 13 submissions. Particularly compelling to me, from a short review,
are Myopia, which is based on µ-recursive functions and pointed me to the
contest, and leaf, a language based on binary tree rewrites.

- [leaf](https://github.com/CRogers/leaf) by Callum Rogers: Uses only one binary
  tree, with operations to manipulate it.

- [Myopia](https://github.com/miikka/myopia) by Miikka Koskinen: Based on
  µ-recursive functions.
- [Vigil](https://github.com/munificent/vigil) by Bob Nystrom: Enforces
  contracts by deleting offending functions from the source code.
- [Turipong](https://github.com/rpav/turipong) by Ryan Pavlik: A Befunge
  derivative inspired by Pong; however it has no user-controlled paddles.

## Shareware VCSes

### ARIS Version Tracking System (AVTS)

Author: Alexander Riedel (1993)

It stores the revision history in a `{project}.RCS` directory (most likely
unrelated to RCS) in a binary format with a log of changes. It works in DOSBox-X
and should be easy to reverse engineer.

From `AVTS11.ZIP/FILE_ID.DIZ`:

> ARIS Version Tracking System (AVTS) is a low cost version
> control/configuration management system. AVTS keeps track of the versions of
> source code modules as for binary files. With SHARE loaded it makes full use
> of file locking for an unlimited number of users. Several tools provide
> reports about the history of certain modules and the access history. By
> Alexander Riedel, ARIS.

Versions:
- [AVTS v1.1](http://annex.retroarchive.org/cdrom/pier-02/038A/AVTS11.ZIP)

- [AVTS v1.3](http://annex.retroarchive.org/cdrom/cotc-ii/PROGRAM/AVTS13.ZIP)
  in Cream of the Crop II - 1993 (listed date: 1993-06-09)

### Version Control & Maintenance System (VCM)

Author: Dennis Allen (1992)

VCM exchanges HOST.ZIP and REMOTE.ZIP files to coordinate changes. It is written
in the Foxpro language and executes in its runtime.

From `VCM.ZIP/FILE_ID.DIZ`:

> The Version Control & Maintenance System is an application that allows
> either the client or the programmer to maintain source code.
>
> As a client, this system allows you to obtain the latest updated source
> code.  As a programmer, this system allows you to maintain another
> programmer's database of source code.  At the same time, other programmers
> can keep up with your modifications.  All without the need to 'check-out'
> program files.  ASP approved.
>
> Note:  This is a Foxpro application and requires the Foxpro runtime unit.
>        Contact C&R Business Systems Ltd. Compu-Serve #73304,1222.

The manual is `VCM.ZIP/FOXPRO.ZIP/VCM.MAN`.

Versions:
- [VCM 02.00.00](http://annex.retroarchive.org/cdrom/smsw-vol6/PROG/VCM.ZIP)
  from So Much Screenware! - Vol 6 1996 Library (listed date: 1995-07-19)

### Automatic Version Control System (AVCS)

Author: Jussi Puttonen (1990)

When I run AVCS in DOSBox-X, it does nothing.

Versions:
- [AVCS v1.1](http://www.retroarchive.org/cdrom/garbo_dos/sysutil/avcs11.zip)
  from garbo.uwasi.fi
  > Automatic Version Control System (backups) v1.1 (good)

# Resources to learn Idris

I want to learn Idris, both as a language to develop with, and to understand its
underlying theory and to [hack on its compiler](../wspace/idris_backend.md).

Edwin Brady's PhD thesis [*Practical Implementation of a Dependently Typed
Functional Programming Language*](https://www.type-driven.org.uk/edwinb/papers/thesis.pdf)
(2005) describes the implementation of a dependently typed core language, TT,
that compiles to a G-machine. It likely forms the basis of Idris, which first
appeared shortly thereafter [in 2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20080320233322/http://www-fp.cs.st-and.ac.uk/~eb/darcs/Idris/).
The thesis complements work that was being done concurrently at Durham on
[Epigram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigram_(programming_language)), a
dependently typed functional programming language, by Conor McBride and James
McKinna.

Edwin gave four lectures for the [Oregon Programming Languages Summer School in
2017](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer17/topics.php)
on “Dependent Types in the Idris Programming Languages”. Videos are also linked
on [his site](https://www.type-driven.org.uk/edwinb/pages/talks.html).

He wrote [*Type-Driven Development with Idris*](https://www.manning.com/books/type-driven-development-with-idris)
(2017), which teaches development using Idris. When reading it for Idris 2, it
requires several [small changes](https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/typedd/typedd.html)
to update it.

He's also written a few [blog posts](https://www.type-driven.org.uk/edwinb/tag/idris.html)
on Idris. In a post explaining [why Idris 2 is faster than Idris 1](https://www.type-driven.org.uk/edwinb/why-is-idris-2-so-much-faster-than-idris-1.html),
he mentions, that it takes insights from Andras Kovacs' work on [smalltt](https://github.com/AndrasKovacs/smalltt).

Idris [documentation](https://www.idris-lang.org/pages/documentation.html) has
more resources.

I should consider applying to be a [PhD student under him](https://www.type-driven.org.uk/edwinb/pages/contact.html).
